        HARPG (Horse Art Roleplay Game) is an RPG based online game, where
        players play through creating art of their horses and other related
        characters. HARPG on it's own does not have a set of rules or playstyle
        dictated by a programmed software. Instead, players come together within
        the community to share stories and/or to breed to obtain new horses.
        Players often make their own breeds which can range from creating real
        horse breed associations, to being fictional but very realistic or
        having magical horns and/or multiple set of wings. The sky is the limit!

        Horse Art Roleplay Game has inspired many other ARPGs (Art Roleplay
        Games). Some even becoming so extensive that they have shifted a lot of
        the admistrative work to an independent website to manage the thousands
        of players and their accounts. Notable ARPG examples include Felvargs,
        Tokotas, DracoStryx and World-of-Reos. <br />
        <br />
        HARPG is based on visual art. As such, character creation is through
        drawing and colouring unique designs. Designs can be entirely
        fantastical, or based on real life genetics.This designing can be one
        the most important part of the game, as all activity afterwards will
        depend on the design. Tools on this website will be geared towards the
        designing side of the game to help newcomers and veterans alike.
